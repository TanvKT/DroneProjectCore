## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

> **Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox&trade; requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".


## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Using the code example

### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool.

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*).

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target).

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**.

   > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you.

   b.	Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box.

   > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box.

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**.

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-wifi-scan](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-wifi-scan)" application with the desired name "WifiScan" configured for the *CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439 --app-id mtb-example-mtb-example-wifi-scan --user-app-name WifiScan --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

</details>



### Open the project

After the project has been created, you can open it in your preferred development environment.


<details><summary><b>Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

If you opened the Project Creator tool from the included Eclipse IDE, the project will open in Eclipse automatically.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>


<details><summary><b>Visual Studio (VS) Code</b></summary>

Launch VS Code manually, and then open the generated *{project-name}.code-workspace* file located in the project directory.

For more details, see the [Visual Studio Code for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBVSCodeUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_vscode_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>


<details><summary><b>Keil µVision</b></summary>

Double-click the generated *{project-name}.cprj* file to launch the Keil µVision IDE.

For more details, see the [Keil µVision for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBuVisionUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_uvision_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>


<details><summary><b>IAR Embedded Workbench</b></summary>

Open IAR Embedded Workbench manually, and create a new project. Then select the generated *{project-name}.ipcf* file located in the project directory.

For more details, see the [IAR Embedded Workbench for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBIARUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_iar_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>


<details><summary><b>Command line</b></summary>

If you prefer to use the CLI, open the appropriate terminal, and navigate to the project directory. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program; on Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. From there, you can run various `make` commands.

For more details, see the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>


## Debugging


You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

<mark> Add the below Note for relevant CEs only, like PSoC 6 MCU based. Remove this note for others.

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

</details>


<details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
</details>



## Design and implementation

Terminologies used in multicore applications - 
   1. **Project** – A directory that contains a Makefile that uses the “core-make” library to build a set of source into a linked ELF image.
   2. **Application** - A directory that contains one or more "Projects" that are meant to build and work together.

In general, the application and individual projects have their own Makefile. The application level Makefile will have `APPLICATION` as the value of the *MTB_TYPE* variable. The project level Makefile will have `PROJECT` as the value of the *MTB_TYPE* variable. The application level Makefile has a variable called *MTB_PROJECT* that list the names of the projects that are associated with the application. The Makefile commands that are issued at the application level will be called for all the listed projects in sequential order. For example, if you issue a build command at the application level, all the listed projects will build one after the other. The resulting combined hex file will have the hex file data from all the listed projects.

This multicore application has two projects: *proj_cm0p* and *proj_cm4*. Both *proj_cm0p* and *proj_cm4* projects share the same design configuration, which is located in the *\<dual-cpu application>/bsps/\<target>/config* folder.

The libraries added through the library manager by default will be downloaded to a folder named *mtb_shared* located one level above the *\<dual-cpu application>* directory. The libraries can be shared or project-specific. When adding the libraries through the library manager, an option is provided to select the project it belongs to. If the same library is added to both projects, then both projects can access the same library copy from the mtb_shared directory.

The Infineon HAL is not yet designed to run simultaneously on CM0+ and CM4 CPU. Because the proj_cm4 already uses HAL, proj_cm0p should only use PDL APIs.

By default, *proj_cm0p* uses only 8192 bytes of SRAM and flash. If you wish to allocate more memory to *proj_cm0p*, follow the instructions from the "Customizing linker scripts" section of [AN215656 - PSoC&trade; 6 MCU dual-CPU system design](https://www.infineon.com/AN215656). You can also refer the same document for other dual-CPU system design best practices.

For more details on the project structure and terminologies, see [AN228571– Getting started with PSoC&trade; 6 MCU on ModusToolbox&trade; software](https://www.infineon.com/AN228571).
